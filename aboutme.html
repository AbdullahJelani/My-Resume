<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a wanderer to say the least, but let me explain. After metric my mom, uncle and brother and law were
  continously asking me about my further education, now you'd think why not my father. So my father had left
  the world long before that's why i was in this situation. Long story short i decided to study male nursing
  on the advise of my brother in law and moved to another city in my country. After a year i came back to my
  home due to some domestic reasons. The next year i started studying commerce in a local college and along
  the way i've felt that this is the right subject for me to study and it has the potential to make me wealthy
  as we were struggling to meet the ends financially and this was the most attractive way of thinking for me
  at that moment. Anyways I studied commerce and business and after graduation started working as a pharma
  reprentative. After some trainings in the company I realized that I must make a SMART goal and eventually
  I wrote that in the coming 10 years I must be a marketing manager. Not realizing about my strenghts and
  weaknesses that was a vague decision. As I known later that I am an introvert and can't handle too much
  of sensory stimulation which is the main part of my job.
  This is my 10th year working in this industry and i've got just one main promotion, working as first line
  manager, 3 promotions back from my goal.

<p>But in the year 2022 I had completly exhausted myself because of the incompatibility of my job vs my personality.
  I explored more from multiple sources like Big Five, MBTI and Enneagram etc, and realized that i must change
  my profession, otherwise i'll become more ill day by day.
</p>

<p>From here my motivation start to study computer languages and make myself independant. But this is not easy
  as I have to study it along with my current job which is at least 12 hours a day after which i am exhausted
  and then I have to give some time to study coding languages. But I am optimistic that i'll succeed one day
  and will become an independant Web Developer.
